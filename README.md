# Menu 🍔

> PROD [Live] : https://react-menu-v2-prod.netlify.app/

#### Menu consists of a straightforward user interface where there is a

- List of menu items available along with the page title **Our Menu**.
- Each single menu item card has an **image**, **name**, **price**, **info**.
- Buttons have been implemented and will get added dynamically that will filter the items in the list depending on the type of categories present in the data. ie. **`ALL`** for the list of all menu items and other category **`Breakfast`** , **`Lunch`** , **`Shakes`** buttons.
- Data is handled by the `data.js` , `images` and styles are handled by `index.css`
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm run dev` to start up the development server on default port 5173.
